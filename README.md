# AI Drug-Target Interaction Predictor

This project is an AI-powered system to predict drug-target interactions using SMILES strings and protein sequences. It utilizes a machine learning model trained on known interaction data to return a predicted KIBA score, indicating the strength of molecular binding. The frontend is a modern web interface connected to a Flask API backend.
